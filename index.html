<h2 id="our-work-together-will-turn-them-into-happy-easy-to-deal-with-tenants-">Our work together will turn them into happy, easy to deal with tenants.</h2>
<h2 id="does-this-sound-like-you-">Does this sound like you?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You are a Sacramento-bay area, property owner of multiple complexes with over 1,000 residents in a college town.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You prefer not to interact with residents and you run your business mostly on paper.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unhappy-hard-to-deal-with-tenants-are-driving-you-crazy-in-all-these-ways-">Unhappy, hard to deal with tenants are driving you crazy in all these ways:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Helicopter parents that want everything perfect for their little angel and are constantly pestering you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tenants and parents are threatening you to sue or contact HOA or posting a poor review.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tenants are complaining to you that there are break-ins and feel unsafe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tenants complaining to you about their leaky toilets and faucets and won&#39;t pay you rent until the issue(s) are resolved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are tired of handling residents who are neglecting to pay rent on time because they are waiting to find a job or get financial aid.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know-it-all tenants that try to tell you how to do your job (fire safety, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tenants are calling you about roaches, ants, rats, mice, bed bugs, and spiders.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="my-name-is-elena-pan-as-a-property-manager-i-help-apartment-complex-owners-with-1-000-tenants-turn-bad-quality-residents-into-high-quality-residents-">My name is Elena Pan. As a property manager, I help apartment complex owners with 1,000+ tenants turn bad quality residents into high quality residents.</h2>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="-what-if-i-already-have-a-property-manager-handling-these-issues-">&quot;What if I already have a property manager handling these issues?&quot;</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re still having these problems, perhaps your property manager is overwhelmed and can use my additional help or information to address these issues.</p>
<h3 id="-what-if-i-already-have-happy-tenants-">&quot;What if I already have happy tenants?&quot;</h3>
<p>This means that we can work other things- perhaps raising quality of life and therefore having even happier tenants, so you can earn more rent. Maybe your rent is too low considering the quality of work you&#39;re doing.</p>
<h3 id="-what-if-i-don-t-have-1-000-residents-">&quot;What if I don&#39;t have 1,000+ residents?&quot;</h3>
<p>These strategies work well for any size complex.</p>
<h3 id="-what-if-most-of-my-tenants-are-not-college-students-">&quot;What if most of my tenants are not college students?&quot;</h3>
<p>I am confident that we can tailor these strategies to you and your tenants.</p>
<h3 id="-why-should-i-trust-you-to-get-this-done-">&quot;Why should I trust you to get this done?&quot;</h3>
<p>I made the following impact on 5th Avenues Real Estate Services complexes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Oversaw 192 apartment units with over 1,000 residents and managed 20 staff members.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Led host-beneficiary partnerships with church groups to land over 300 high quality tenants.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lowered rent delinquency by 50% compared to the previous year and maintained 100% occupancy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Condensed leasing period from four months to three weeks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Boosted the retention rate by ~10% to 70%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operated the front desk while hitting tight deadlines for multiple projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calmed upset parents and tenants by resolving their issues, turning unhappy tenants into ideal tenants.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Promoted to full-time operations manager over 20 other seasonal staff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-em-what-if-we-don-t-work-well-together-or-this-takes-too-long-or-this-is-ineffective-em-"><em>&quot;What if we don&#39;t work well together or this takes too long or this is ineffective?&quot;</em></h2>
<p>We can do an evaluation at the one-month mark and if you feel like this isn&#39;t for you, we can stop working together at no cost to you.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-love-this-work-i-used-to-be-an-unhappy-tenant">Why do I love this work? I used to be an unhappy tenant</h2>
<p>As a former unhappy tenant I discovered the real reasons why tenants are unhappy and used these discoveries during my time as a property manager to create happy tenants—it is a beautiful coincidence that my quest for happy tenants makes great business sense for owners.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-fix-your-low-quality-tenant-problem-">Let&#39;s fix your low-quality tenant problem.</h2>
<p>Email me at <code>epan&nbsp;a&#116;&nbsp;ucdavis.edu</code> and let&#39;s talk.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>P.S. These problems fascinate me—even if you&#39;re not interested in working together, I&#39;d love to hear from you.</p>
